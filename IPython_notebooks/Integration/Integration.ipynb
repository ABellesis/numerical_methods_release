    "## ** 1.1  Midpoint Rule **\n",
    "\n",
    "One numerical method for approximating integrals is the midpoint rule.  This method uses a simple polynomial, $p(x)$, to represent a function, $f(x)$, over a particular interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int_a^b f(x)dx \\ \\approx \\ \\int_a^b p(x)dx $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This numerical approximation utilizes a single point, the midpoint, $mp$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ mp\\ =\\ \\frac{a+b}{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int_a^b p(x)dx \\ = \\ \\int_a^b f(mp)dx \\ = \\ (b-a) f(mp) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "For the midpoint method to yield a reasonable result, we break up the interval into several subintervals, apply the midpoint rule to each subinterval, and sum over all subintervals. This implementation is known as the composite midpoint rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell, necessary packages are imported such as NumPy, which is needed to preform certain mathmatical operations, and Matplotlib, required for visualization. We also define the function that we want analyze. By default the function is defined as $sin(x)$, but you are encouraged to try your own function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An important note for this notebooks: **when defining functions, you may want to explore functions not included in Python by default, such as sin(), cos(), e, etc. We typically incoporate these functions through the Numpy module by first importing Numpy as np in the beginning of our code and then defining these functions as np.sin(), np.cos(), and np.exp(). However, for this notebook, we will use a slightly different module called Sympy to define these functions. As you can see under imports, we have imported Sympy as syp. This means when you want to define functions, we will import them as syp.sin(), syp.cos(), syp.exp(). Sympy is a package that will help us calculate the analytical integral using Python, saving you the trouble from calculating them by hand.  "

    "Of the three approximations with equally spaced abscissa, Simpson's gives the most accurate approximation, followed by trapezoidal, and midpoint. However, as observed in the test case of $sin(x)$, there are some problems in which the error cancellation of midpoint rule allows great performance. Gaussian quadrature tends to be the most accurate of the methods presented for 1-dimensional systems.  The necessity of Legendre polynomials can become costly for certain functions, which may render another method more effective. Monte Carlo methods may seem to underperform compared to the other methods for these 1-dimensional problems; however, Monte Carlo methods perform very well on higher dimensional problems."
