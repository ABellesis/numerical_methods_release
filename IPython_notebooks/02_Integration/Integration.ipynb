    "Of the three approximations with equally spaced abscissa, Simpson's method gives the most accurate approximation, followed by trapezoidal, and midpoint. However, as observed in the test case, the cancellation of errors artificially suggests the midpoint rule performs well. Gaussian quadrature tends to be the most accurate method for 1-dimensional functions. However, the necessity of Legendre polynomials can become costly for certain functions, which may render another method more effective. Monte Carlo methods, which seems to underperform compared to the other methods, is very effective when applied to higher dimensional functions."
