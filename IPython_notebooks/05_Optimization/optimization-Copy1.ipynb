    "# 5. Optimization methods\n",
    "Optimization methods attempt to find the minimum or maximum of functions. Here the steepest descent, conjugate gradient, Newton-Raphson, and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno methods are presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions with two variables can be visualized as a surface (i.e., a contour map) where the lowest and highest point on the map corresponds to the function’s max and min.  Although higher dimensional functions cannot be readily visualized, the analogy of traversing a surface is still convenient. Using the map concept, one can appreciate the general features of these algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tSelect an initial guess, which is a point on the surface\n",
    "2.\tDetermine a direction to move\n",
    "3.\tTake a step by moving along the determined direction\n",
    "4.\tTest for convergence (Is the difference between the function’s values for the last two points less than a threshold value?)\n",
    "5.\tRepeat steps 2 to 4 to continue searching surface\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most significant difference in the algorithms presented in this notebook is how each defines the step direction. The various approaches are described in the following sections.  It is important to emphasize that numerical optimizations can be extremely time consuming.  For the optimization to complete in a reasonable amount of time, the threshold for the convergence criteria must be selected with care.  In addition, an optimization algorithm should always limit the number of iterations so as not to get stuck in an endless search.  Lastly, the method should keep track of the step size because an indication that the search is proceeding successfully is a decrease in successive step sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.1 Steepest Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "The steepest descent method is the simplest iterative method of optimization method. Steepest descent makes iterative steps in the direction of greatest decrease. A function’s gradient at a point determines the direction where the rate of changes is the highest.  Thus the opposite direction will be the steepest decent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an initial guess, $x_0$, the search direction, $sd_0$, that is in the direction of steepest descent becomes\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ sd_0 = -\\nabla f(x_0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A step is taken by using a line search minimization along this search direction, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_i = x_0 + \\lambda sd_0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ minimizes $f(x)$ in the search direction. For simplicity, the details of the of the minimization are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "A new search direction is constructed as the direction of steepest descent at the new point.\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ sd_i = -\\nabla f(x_i)$$\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "As an example, the cell directly below implements steepest descent on the function,\n",
    " $$ f(x,y) = sin(0.5x^2-0.25y^2+3)*cos(2x+1-e^y)$$\n",
    "Following the code is an image depicting steepest descent implemented on the surface of this function.\n"
