When evaluating the root of a function, methods that incorporate a derivative of the function are known as Householder methods.  For instance, the Newton-Raphson method (discussed above) utilizes the first derivative of the function and is known as a 1st class Householder method.  Second in the class of Householder methods is Halley's method, which incorporates the second derivative of the function. \n",

If unable to be calculated with ease, it is more useful to carry out additional steps of Newton-Raphson.\n",
