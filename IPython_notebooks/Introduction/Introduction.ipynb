    "\n",
    "###  Running the Code blocks\n",
    "Throughout the notebook you will run into cells which contain Python code. This code is intended to be run by you! To do so, click the play/run button found in the toolbar at the top of this page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assigning Variables\n",
    "We often have specific numbers or characters we wish to refer to and/or manipulate multiple times. In coding, it is convienint to assign values to variables, which allows us to code quickly and reduce the risk of input errors. As an example, let's say we wanted to perform a bunch of different calculations of the number $6.75892$. Instead of typing this out each time we can assign it to a variable called \n",
    "`x`. We do this as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "`` x = 6.75892 ``\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, throughout our code we can refer to this number as 'x'. You can name your variables anything you want as long as they don't conatain spaces or special characters (excluding underscores). As above, to assign a value to a speicifc variable you just place the variable name on the left hand side of an equal sign and the variable you want to assign on the right hand side.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Comments\n",
    "When writing code, sometimes you will want to provide notes about the purpose of a particular section of code. These comments on the code can serve as a reminder for you or others using the code.  \n",
    "In many coding languages, you can insert text  that will be ignored by inserting certain characters. For Python, if we begin a line of code with a pound symbol (#), the text  will be ignored, allowing us to write notes to ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# This code performs the multiplication of two variables.\n",
    "x = 6.5\n",
    "y = 7.63\n",

Some of these libraries are essential for doing scientific calculations (Numpy, Sympy, and Scipy). Other libraries are used to visualize our data and create plots, such as Matplotlib. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way that we do this is by putting an **```include```** line at the top of our script. The best coding practice is importing each library with a specific abbreviated name, which ensures  the program to refer to the library specifically each time you want to call a function from that library. This avoids ambiguity when two libraries have functions that share the same name.\n",
